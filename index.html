		Let’s face it, as our people get older, they seem to misplace things more often. But when you attach this coin-size tracking device to an item and lose the item, you have a 20,000-times chance of getting it back. The accompanying app enlists the network of 20,000 <a id="PinLead33" href="https://deals.getxyfindit.io/KW2RKTP/WKJSQ9/" target="_blank"> XY™ Find It</a> users to locate your lost bag, bike or dog. You can also track your lost wallet (or whatever) yourself. </p>

		<p>
The XY™ Find It app displays how far you are from your keys or purse you dropped, and it will sound the alarm to help you pinpoint its exact location. If you realize you left your bag in another location, all other XY™ Find It users in the network are notified, and when one passes your missing article, you’ll get an update sent to your phone. 
		</p>

		<p>
			What if you can’t find your phone? Use XY™ Find It to ring it, even if it’s on silent mode, and you’ll find your phone fast. XY™ Find It helps you keep your stuff…especially if you’re a chronic (keys/wallet/bike/car/bag) misplacer.

Bondic won’t form its rock-solid bond until you’ve shined the light, so you can reshape it over and over until you get it just right. It’s absolutely amazing for DIYers… it won’t be long before glue is a thing of the past!

<p>11.1.

<p>11.2. If you intend to seek arbitration, you must first send to us, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice must be mailed to <a href="mailto:support@yourstips.com">support@yourstips.com</a>. It must be addressed to the attention of Legal Counsel. The Notice shall describe the nature and basis of the claim or disputes and the specific relief sought. If we cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence arbitration.</p>

<p>11.3. All arbitrations required by these Terms will be conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator's award is binding and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration brought under these Terms may be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Unless we and you agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate your claim with any other claim and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, private attorney general or class proceeding.</p>

<p>11.4. For arbitration claims you assert against us in accordance with this Section 13, we will pay all of your administrative, hearing, and arbitrator's fees and costs for the arbitration but not the fees, expenses, and costs of your lawyers, experts, or witnesses in excess of any filing fee you would have been required to pay to file the claim as a lawsuit in a state or federal court (whichever is greater) in the judicial district in which you reside. The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. Similarly, an arbitration award and any judgment confirming it can apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by all parties.</p>

<p>11.5. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU WILL NOT AGREE TO ACT AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT AGAINST US IN ANY COURT, OR IN ARBITRATION, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS RELATING IN ANY WAY TO US OR OUR WEBSITE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ORDERS MADE FROM OUR WEBSITE, OUR ADVERTISEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES, EMAIL OR RELATING TO THE COLLECTION OR USE OF ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IN CONNECTION WITH OUR WEBSITE, THESE TERMS, OR YOUR STATUS AS A PURCHASER OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. THIS SECTION 14 WILL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND US.</p>

<h3>12. Applicable law.</h3>
<p>By visiting our Website, you agree that the laws of Israel, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and us.</p>

<h3>13. General Terms.</h3>
<p>No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms. These terms constitute the entire agreement between us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of the enforcement of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. These Terms are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you, except with our prior written consent. The headings in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms include and incorporate by reference the posted Privacy Policy on our Website.</p>
